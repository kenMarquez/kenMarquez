# Hi, I'm Ken MÃ¡rquez ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about contributing to open-source projects and have a keen interest in mobile and web development technologies. Here's a glimpse into my contributions and the technologies I work with.

## My Open Source Contributions

I believe in the power of open source to foster innovation and collaboration. Below are some of the contributions I've made to various projects, aiming to improve functionality, fix critical bugs, and enhance documentation.

### React Native Firebase
- **Description**: Fixed a critical NullPointerException (NPE) issue by updating the `firebase-android-sdk` version from 29.0.2 to 29.0.3.
- **Link to PR/Issue**: [Fix app crash on Android](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/pull/5946)

### Lottie React Native
- **Description**: Added a new `renderMode` property for Android to fix a crash, alongside updating the documentation to reflect this new addition.
- **Link to PR/Issue**: [Add renderMode property for Android](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native/pull/654)

### React Native Voice
- **Description**: Implemented support for Android target versions >= 11 by adding `RecognitionService` query in the manifest, streamlining the setup process for developers targeting Android 11 and above.
- **Link to PR/Issue**: [Support Android target >= 11](https://github.com/react-native-voice/voice/pull/364)

### React Native Shake
- **Description**: Updated the Gradle configuration to dynamically use the `rootProject` values for the Android target API level, ensuring compliance with new Google Play requirements and improving project compatibility.
- **Link to PR/Issue**: [Dynamic Gradle values for better compatibility](https://github.com/Doko-Demo-Doa/react-native-shake/pull/23)

### AWS Parameter Store Env Manager

- **Description**: I authored `aws-parameter-store-env-manager`, a tool designed to streamline the management of environment variables for different development stages. It simplifies configuring environment variable files, allowing for quick transitions between environments.
- **NPM Package**: [aws-parameter-store-env-manager on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-parameter-store-env-manager)
- **GitHub Repository**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/Mariachi-IO/aws-parameter-store-env-manager)
